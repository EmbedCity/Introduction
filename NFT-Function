The functionality of the Embed City Reserve (ECR) Tree NFT extends beyond just digital ownership. When a user purchases an ECR Tree NFT, they are not only contributing to reforestation efforts but also receiving additional Carbon NFT and Oxygen NFT tokens, each with distinct functionalities that highlight their environmental impact.

1. **ECR Tree NFT:**
   - This NFT represents ownership of a specific tree in a reforestation area.
   - It is a digital certificate of your commitment to environmental sustainability.
   - Through the purchase of this NFT, you directly fund the planting and maintenance of the corresponding physical tree in the designated reforestation site.
   - You can monitor the growth and progress of your tree through geolocation and updates provided by the ECR platform.
   - By owning an ECR Tree NFT, you become part of a global community actively participating in reforestation efforts.

2. **Carbon NFT:**
   - The Carbon NFT represents the carbon sequestration capacity of the tree associated with your ECR Tree NFT.
   - It symbolizes the amount of carbon dioxide the tree is estimated to absorb from the atmosphere during its lifespan.
   - Owning a Carbon NFT showcases your contribution to reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change.
   - The value of the Carbon NFT increases over time as the tree grows and continues to sequester carbon.

3. **Oxygen NFT:**
   - The Oxygen NFT represents the oxygen production capacity of the tree linked to your ECR Tree NFT.
   - It signifies the amount of oxygen the tree is expected to release into the atmosphere during its lifetime.
   - Owning an Oxygen NFT highlights your support for improving air quality and providing a vital resource for life.
   - Similar to the Carbon NFT, the Oxygen NFT's value appreciates as the tree flourishes and produces more oxygen.

In summary, the ECR Tree NFT goes beyond a simple digital collectible. It serves as a gateway to environmental impact, providing participants with Carbon NFT and Oxygen NFT tokens that quantifiably represent the ecological benefits of the tree they've contributed to. This innovative approach not only emphasizes the tangible benefits of reforestation but also educates and engages individuals in the ongoing global effort to combat climate change and preserve our planet's biodiversity.
